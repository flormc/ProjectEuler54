# Project Euler 54 - Poker Game Solution 

## Overview

This repository contains a Java program that simulates a poker game. The program reads input from a file, creates two players, evaluates their hands, and determines the winner based on poker hand rankings.

## How It Works

1. **Input Reading:** The program reads input from a file, where each line represents a poker game with two players.
2. **Player Creation:** It creates two players from the input, assigning them hands of five cards each.
3. **Hand Evaluation:** The hands of both players are evaluated based on standard poker hand rankings.
4. **Winner Determination:** The program compares the two hands and declares the winner or a tie.

## What I Like

- **Modularity:** The code is modular, making it easy to understand and maintain.
- **Readability:** Efforts have been made to keep the code readable and well-organized.

## What I Don't Like

- **Error Handling:** The program could benefit from improved error handling, especially when dealing with malformed input files.
- **User Interaction:** It might be useful to add more user interaction or logging for better feedback during execution.

## Technologies/Approaches

- **Java:** Utilized for its object-oriented features and platform independence.
- **File Reading:** Implemented file reading to handle input data.
- **JUnit:** Used for unit testing the poker game logic.
